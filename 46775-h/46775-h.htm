<p class='c003' ><i>In 18th-century America, the pleasant practice of taking tea at
home was an established social custom with a recognized code of manners
and distinctive furnishings. Pride was taken in a correct and
fashionable tea table whose equipage included much more than teapot,
cups, and saucers.</i></p>

<p class='c004' ><i>It was usually the duty of the mistress to make and pour the tea;
and it was the duty of the guests to be adept at handling a teacup and
saucer and to provide social “chitchat.” Because of the expense and
time involved, the tea party was limited to the upper classes;
consequently, such an affair was a status symbol. The cocktail
party of the 20th century has, perhaps, replaced the tea party of the
18th century as a social custom, reflecting the contrast between the
relaxed atmosphere of yesterday with the hurried pace of today.</i></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c006'     >The Americans “use much tea,” noted the Abbé
Robin during his visit to this country in 1781.
“The greatest mark of civility and welcome
they can show you, is to invite you to drink it with
them.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Tea was the social beverage of the 18th century;
serving it was a sign of politeness and hospitality, and
drinking it was a custom with distinctive manners and
specific equipment. Most discussions of the commodity
have dealt only with its political, historical,
or economic importance; however, in order to understand
the place tea holds in this country’s past, it
also is important to consider the beverage in terms
of the social life and traditions of the Americans. As
the Abbé Robin pointed out, not only was tea an
important commodity on this side of the Atlantic, but
the imbibing of it was an established social practice.</p>

<p class='c004' >An examination of teatime behavior and a consideration
of what utensils were used or thought
appropriate for tea drinking are of help in reconstructing
and interpreting American history as well
as in furnishing and re-creating interiors of the period,
thus bringing into clearer focus the picture of daily
life in 18th-century America. For these reasons, and
because the subject has received little attention, the
present study has been undertaken.</p>

<p class='c004' >Tea had long been known and used in the Orient
before it was introduced into Europe in the early
part of the 17th century. At about the same time
two other new beverages appeared, chocolate from
the Americas and coffee from the Near East. The
presence of these commodities in European markets
is indicative of the vigorous exploration and active
trade of that century, which also witnessed the successful
settlement of colonies in North America. By
about mid-17th century the new beverages were
being drunk in England, and by the 1690’s were
being sold in New England. At first chocolate was
preferred, but coffee, being somewhat cheaper, soon
replaced it and in England gave rise to a number of
public places of refreshment known as coffee houses.
Coffee was, of course, the primary drink of these
establishments, but that tea also was available is
indicated by an advertisement that appeared in an
English newspaper in 1658. One of the earliest
advertisements for tea, it announced:</p>

<p class='c008' >That Excellent, and by all Physitians approved, <em>China</em>
Drink, called by the <em>Chineans</em>, <em>Tcha</em>, by other nations <em>Tay
alias Tee</em>, is sold at the <em>Sultaness-head</em>, a <em>Cophee-house</em> in
<em>Sweetings</em> Rents by The Royal Exchange, London.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >For a time tea was esteemed mainly for its curative
powers, which explains why it was “by all Physitians
approved.” According to an English broadside published
in 1660, the numerous contemporary ailments
which tea “helpeth” included “the headaches, giddiness,
and heaviness.” It was also considered “good
for colds, dropsies and scurvies and [it] expelleth
infection. It prevents and cures agues, surfeits and
fevers.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a> By the end of the 17th century, however,
tea’s medicinal qualities had become secondary to its
fashionableness as a unique drink. Tea along with
the other exotic and novel imports from the Orient
such as fragile porcelains, lustrous silks, and painted
wallpapers had captured the European imagination.
Though the beverage was served in public pleasure
gardens as well as coffee houses during the early
1700’s in England, social tea drinking in the home
was gradually coming into favor. The coffee houses
continued as centers of political, social, and literary
influence as well as of commercial life into the first
half of the 19th century, for apparently Englishmen
preferred to drink their coffee in public rather than
private houses and among male rather than mixed
company. This was in contrast to tea, which was
drunk in the home with breakfast or as a morning
beverage and socially at afternoon gatherings of both
sexes, as we see in the painting <cite>An English Family at
Tea</cite> (<a href='#frontis'>frontispiece</a>). As tea drinking in the home became
fashionable, both host and hostess took pride in a
well-appointed tea table, for a teapot of silver or
fragile blue-and-white Oriental porcelain with matching
cups and saucers and other equipage added
prestige as well as elegance to the teatime ritual.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004' >At first the scarcity and expense of the tea, the costly
paraphernalia used to serve it, and the leisure considered
necessary to consume it, limited the use of this
commodity to the upper classes. For these reasons,
social tea drinking was, understandably, a prestige
custom. One becomes increasingly aware of this
when looking at English paintings and prints of the
early 18th century, such as <cite>Family Group</cite> (<a href='#fig1'>fig. 1</a>),
painted by Gawen Hamilton about 1730. Family
members are portrayed in the familiar setting of their
own parlor with its paneled walls and comfortable
furnishings. Their pet, a small dog, surveys the scene
from a resting place on a corner of the carpet. Teatime
appears to have just begun, for cups are still being
passed around and others on the table await filling
from the nearby porcelain teapot. It seems reasonable
to assume, since the painting is portraiture, that
the family is engaged in an activity which, although
familiar, is considered suitable to the group’s social
position and worthy of being recorded in oil. That
tea drinking was a status symbol also is indicated by
the fact that the artist has used the tea ceremony as
the theme of the picture and the tea table as the focal
point.</p>

<p class='c004' >Eighteenth-century pictures and writings are basic
source materials for information about Anglo-American
tea drinking. (See the <a href='#chronlist'>chronological list of pictures consulted</a>,
on page 90.) A number of the
pictures are small-scale group or conversation piece
paintings of English origin in which family and friends
are assembled at tea, similar to <cite>Family Group</cite>, and they
provide pictorial information on teatime modes and
manners. The surroundings in which the partakers
of tea are depicted also reveal information about the
period and about the gracious living enjoyed in the
better homes. Paneled walls and comfortable chairs,
handsome chests and decorative curtains, objects of
ceramic and silver and glass, all were set down on
canvas or paper with painstaking care, and sometimes
with a certain amount of artistic license. A careful
study of these paintings provides an excellent guide for
furnishing and reconstructing period rooms and exhibits,
even to the small details such as objects on
mantels, tables, and chests, thus further documenting
data from newspapers, journals, publications, and
writings of the same period.</p>

<p class='c004' >In America, as in England, tea had a rather limited
use as a social beverage during the early 1700’s.
Judge Samuel Sewall, the recorder-extraordinary of
Boston life at the turn of the 17th century, seems to
have mentioned tea only once in his copious diary.
In the entry for April 15, 1709, Sewall wrote that he
had attended a meeting at the residence of Madam
Winthrop where the guests “drunk Ale, Tea, Wine.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
At this time ale and wine, in contrast to tea, were
fairly common drinks. Since tea and the equipment
used to serve it were costly, social tea drinking was
restricted to the prosperous and governing classes
who could afford the luxury. The portrayal of the
rotund silver teapot and other tea-drinking equipment
in such an American painting as <cite>Susanna Truax</cite> (<a href='#fig2'>fig. 2</a>),
done by an unknown painter in 1730, indicates
that in this country as in England not only was the tea
ceremony of social importance but also that a certain
amount of prestige was associated with the equipage.
And, the very fact that an artist was commissioned for
a portrait of this young girl is suggestive of a more
than ordinary social status of the sitter and activity
depicted.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >English customs were generally imitated in this
country, particularly in the urban centers. Of Boston,
where he visited in 1740, Joseph Bennett observed
that “the ladies here visit, drink tea and indulge
every little piece of gentility to the height of the
mode and neglect the affairs of their families with as
good grace as the finest ladies in London.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a> English
modes and manners remained a part of the social behavior
after the colonies became an independent
nation. Visitors to the newly formed United States
were apt to remark about such habits as tea drinking,
as did Brissot de Warville in 1788, that “in this, as in
their whole manner of living, the Americans in general
resemble the English.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Therefore, it is not surprising
to find that during the 18th century the serving
of tea privately in the morning and socially in the
afternoon or early evening was an established custom
in many households.</p>

<p class='c004' >The naturalist Peter Kalm, during his visit to North
America in the mid-18th century, noted that tea was
a breakfast beverage in both Pennsylvania and New
York. From the predominantly Dutch town of
Albany in 1749 he wrote that “their breakfast is tea,
commonly without milk.” At another time, Kalm<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
stated:</p>

<p class='c008' >With the tea was eaten bread and butter or buttered
bread toasted over the coals so that the butter penetrated
the whole slice of bread. In the afternoon about three
o’clock tea was drunk again in the same fashion, except
that bread and butter was not served with it.</p>

<p class='c004' >This tea-drinking schedule was followed throughout
the colonies. In Boston the people “take a great
deal of tea in the morning,” have dinner at two
o’clock, and “about five o’clock they take more tea,
some wine, madeira [and] punch,”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a> reported the
Baron Cromot du Bourg during his visit in 1781.
The Marquis de Chastellux confirms his countryman’s
statement about teatime, mentioning that the
Americans take “tea and punch in the afternoon.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >During the first half of the 18th century the limited
amount of tea available at prohibitively high prices
restricted its use to a proportionately small segment
of the total population of the colonies. About mid-century,
however, tea was beginning to be drunk
by more and more people, as supplies increased and
costs decreased, due in part to the propaganda and
merchandising efforts of the East India Company.
According to Peter Kalm, tea, chocolate, and coffee
had been “wholly unknown” to the Swedish population
of Pennsylvania and the surrounding area before
the English arrived, but in 1748 these beverages “at
present constitute even the country people’s daily
breakfast.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> A similar observation was made a few
years later by Israel Acrelius:<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >Tea, coffee, and chocolate are so general as to be found
in the most remote cabins, if not for daily use, yet for
visitors, mixed with Muscovado, or raw sugar.</p>

<p class='c004' >America was becoming a country of tea drinkers.
Then, in 1767, the Townshend Act imposed a duty
on tea, among other imported commodities. Merchants
and citizens in opposition to the act urged a
boycott of the taxed articles. A Virginia woman, in
a letter<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a> to friends in England, wrote in 1769:</p>

<p class='c008' >... I have given up the Article of Tea, but some are not
quite so tractable; however if wee can convince the good
folks on your side the Water of their Error, wee may hope
to see happier times.</p>

<p class='c004' >In spite of the tax many colonists continued to indulge
in tea drinking. By 1773 the general public, according
to one Philadelphia merchant, “can afford
to come at this piece of luxury” while one-third of
the population “at a moderate computation, drink tea
twice a day.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> It was at this time, however, that
efforts were made to enforce the English tea tax and
the result was that most famous of tea parties, the
“Boston Tea Party.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Thereafter, an increasing number of colonists
abstained from tea drinking as a patriotic gesture.
Philip Fithian, a tutor at Nomini Hall, the Virginia
plantation of Col. Robert Carter, wrote in his journal
on Sunday, May 29, 1774:</p>

<p class='c008' >After dinner we had a Grand &amp; agreeable Walk in &amp;
through the Gardens—There is great plenty of Strawberries,
some Cherries, Goose berries &amp;c.—Drank Coffee at four,
they are now too patriotic to use tea.</p>
<p class='c004' >And indeed they were patriotic, for by September
the taste of tea almost had been forgotten at Nomini
Hall, as Fithian vividly recounted in his journal:<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >Something in our palace this Evening, very merry happened—Mrs.
<em>Carter</em> made a dish of Tea. At Coffee, she sent
me a dish—&amp; the Colonel both ignorant—He smelt, sipt—look’d—At
last with great gravity he asks what’s this?—Do
you ask Sir—Poh!—And out he throws it splash a sacrifice
to Vulcan.</p>

<p class='c004' >Other colonists, in their own way, also showed their
distaste for tea (see <a href='#fig3'>fig. 3</a>). Shortly before the outbreak
of the American Revolution there appeared in
several newspapers an expression of renouncement in
rhyme, “A Lady’s Adieu to Her Tea-Table”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a> (below),

<p class='c010' >Many people gave up tea for the duration of the
war and offered various substitute beverages such as
coffee and dried raspberry leaves, “a detestable drink”
which the Americans “had the heroism to find good,”
remarked a postwar visitor, Léon Chotteau.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Although the colonists had banished tea “with
enthusiasm,” the tea habit was not forgotten. Chotteau
further noted that “they all drink tea in America
as they drink wine in the South of France.” Tea
drinking continued to be an important social custom
in the new nation well into the 19th century.</p>

<p class='c004' >The tea ceremony, sometimes simple, sometimes
elaborate, was the very core of family life. Moreau
de St. Méry observed in 1795, during his residence in
Philadelphia, that “the whole family is united at tea,
to which friends, acquaintances and even strangers
are invited.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a> That teatime hospitality was offered
to the newest of acquaintances or “even strangers” is
verified by Claude Blanchard. He wrote of his visit
to Newport, Rhode Island, on July 12, 1780,
that “in the evening there was an illumination. I
entered the house of an inhabitant, who received me
very well; I took tea there, which was served by a
young lady.” And while staying in Boston, Blanchard
mentioned that a new acquaintance “invited us to
come in the evening to take tea at his house. We went
there; the tea was served by his daughter.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >In the daily routine of activities when the hour for
tea arrived, Moreau de St. Méry remarked that “the
mistress of the house serves it and passes it around.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
In the words of another late-18th-century diarist,
the Marquis de Barbé-Marbois, those present might
“seat themselves at a spotless mahogany table, and
the eldest daughter of the household or one of the
youngest married women makes the tea and gives a
cup to each person in the company.” <cite>Family Group</cite>
(<a href='#fig1'>fig. 1</a>) provides an illustration of this practice
in the early part of the century. During the tea hour
social and economic affairs were discussed, gossip
exchanged, and, according to Barbé-Marbois, “when
there is no news at all, they repeat old stories.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Many entries in Nancy Shippen’s journal<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a> between
1783 and 1786 indicate that this Philadelphian passed
many such hours in a similar manner. On March
11, 1785, she wrote: “About 4 in the Afternoon
D<sup>r</sup> Cutting came in, &amp; we spent the afternoon in the
most agreable chit-chat manner, drank a very
good dish of Tea together &amp; then separated.” Part
of an undated entry in December 1783 reads: “This
Afternoon we were honor’d with the Company of
Gen<sup>l</sup> Washington to Tea, M<sup>rs</sup> &amp; Major Moore,
M<sup>rs</sup> Stewart M<sup>r</sup> Powel M<sup>r</sup> B Washington, &amp; two or
3 more.” If acquaintances of Nancy’s own age were
present or the company large, the tea hour often
extended well into the evening with singing, conversing,
dancing, and playing of whist, chess, or
cards. Of one such occasion she wrote:<a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >M<sup>rs</sup> Allen &amp; the Miss Chews drank Tea with me &amp; spent
the even’g. There was half a dozen agreable &amp; sensible
men that was of the party. The conversation was carried
on in the most sprightly, agreable manner, the Ladies
bearing by far the greatest part—till nine when cards was
proposed, &amp; about ten, refreshments were introduced which
concluded the Evening.</p>

<p class='c004' >Obviously, young men and women enjoyed the
sociability of teatime, for it provided an ideal occasion
to get acquainted. When the Marquis de Chastellux
was in Philadelphia during the 1780’s he went one
afternoon to “take tea with Madam Shippen,” and
found musical entertainment to meet with his approval
and a relationship between the sexes which
had parental sanction. One young miss played on
the clavichord, and “Miss Shippen sang with timidity
but a very pretty voice,” accompanied for a time by
Monsieur Otto on the harp. Dancing followed,
noted the Marquis, “while mothers and other grave
personages conversed in another room.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c007'><sup>[22]</sup></a> In New
York as in Philadelphia teatime was an important
part of the younger set’s social schedule. Eliza
Bowne, writing to her sister in January 1810, reported
that “as to news—New York is not so gay as last
Winter, few balls but a great many tea-parties.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c007'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The feminine interest and participation in such gatherings
of personable young men and attractive young
women was expressed by Nancy Shippen<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c007'><sup>[24]</sup></a> when she
wrote in her journal after such a party:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Saturday night at 11 o’clock. I had a very large company
at Tea this Evening. The company is but just broke
up, I dont know when I spent a more merry Even<sup>g</sup>. We
had music, Cards, &amp;c &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c004' >A masculine view of American tea parties was openly
voiced by one foreign visitor, Prince de Broglie, who,
upon arrival in America in 1782, “only knew a few
words of English, but knew better how to drink
excellent tea with even better cream, how to tell a
lady she was pretty, and a gentleman he was sensible,
by reason whereof I possessed all the elements of
social success.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c007'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Similar feelings were expressed by
the Comte de Ségur during his sojourn in America
in the late 18th century when, in a letter to his wife
in France, he wrote: “My health continues excellent,
despite the quantity of tea one must drink with the
ladies out of gallantry, and of madeira all day long
with the men out of politeness.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c007'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Festive tea parties such as the ones described above
are the subject of some of the group portraits or
conversation pieces painted about 1730 by the English
artist William Hogarth. <cite>The Assembly at Wanstead
House</cite>, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
illustrates quite an elegant affair taking place in a
large, richly decorated, English interior. The artist
has filled the canvas with people standing and conversing
while a seated group plays cards at a table in
the center of the room. To one side near the fireplace
a man and two women drinking tea are seated at an
ornately carved, square tea table with a matching
stand for the hot water kettle. On a dish or circular
stand in the center of the table is a squat teapot with
matching cups and saucers arranged in parallel rows
on either side.</p>

<p class='c004' >Tea-drinking guests seem to have been free to sit
or stand according to their own pleasure or the number
of chairs available, and Barbé-Marbois noted that
at American tea parties “people change seats, some
go, others come.” The written and visual materials
offer little in the way of evidence to suggest that in
general men stood and women sat during teatime.
In fact, places at the tea table were taken by both
sexes, even at formal tea parties such as the one depicted
in <cite>The Assembly at Wanstead House</cite>.</p>

<p class='c004' >A less formal but more usual tea scene is the subject
of another Hogarth painting, <cite>The Wollaston Family</cite>,
now in the Leicester Art Gallery, England. The
afternoon gathering has divided into two groups, one
playing cards, the other drinking tea. An atmosphere
of ease and comfort surrounds the party. The
men and women seated at the card table are discussing
the hand just played, while the women seated
about the square tea table in front of the fireplace are
engaged in conversation. A man listens as he stands
and stirs his tea. Each drinker holds a saucer with a
cup filled from the teapot on a square tile or stand in
the center of the table. One woman is returning her
cup, turned upside down on the saucer, to the table.
More about this particular habit later.</p>

<p class='c004' >The same pleasant social atmosphere seen in English
paintings seems to have surrounded teatime in
America, as the previously cited entries in Nancy
Shippen’s journal book suggest. Her entry for January
18, 1784,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c007'><sup>[27]</sup></a> supplies a description that almost
matches <cite>The Wollaston Family</cite>:</p>

<p class='c008' >“A stormy day, alone till the afternoon; &amp; then was
honor’d with the Company of M<sup>r</sup> Jones (a gentleman
lately from Europe) M<sup>r</sup> Du Ponceau, &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Hollingsworth
at Tea—We convers’d on a variety of subjects &amp; play<sup>d</sup> at
whist, upon the whole spent an agreable Even<sup>g</sup>.”</p>

<p class='c004' >Tea was not only a beverage of courtship; it also was
associated with marriage. Both Peter Kalm, in 1750,
and Moreau de St. Méry, in the 1790’s, report the
Philadelphia custom of expressing good wishes to a
newly married couple by paying them a personal
visit soon after the marriage. It was the duty of the
bride to serve wine and punch to the callers before
noon and tea and wine in the afternoon.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c007'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >No doubt, make-believe teatime and pretend tea
drinking were a part of some children’s playtime
activities. Perhaps many a little girl played at serving
tea and dreamed of having a tea party of her own,
but few were as fortunate as young Peggy Livingston
who, at about the age of five, was allowed to invite
“by card ... 20 young misses” to her own “Tea
Party &amp; Ball.” She “treated them with all good
things, &amp; a violin,” wrote her grandfather. There
were “5 coaches at y<sup>e</sup> door at 10 when they departed.
I was much amused 2 hours.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c007'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Tea seems to have been the excuse for many a
social gathering, large or small, formal or informal.
And sometimes an invitation to drink tea meant a
rather elegant party. “That is to say,” wrote one
cosmopolitan observer of the American scene in the
1780’s, the Marquis de Chastellux, “to attend a sort
of assembly pretty much like the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">conversazioni</span></i> [social
gathering] of Italy; for tea here, is the substitute for
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rinfresco</span></i> [refreshment].”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> A view of such an
event has been depicted in the English print <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Conversazioni</span></i>
(<a href='#fig4'>fig. 4</a>), published in 1782. It is hoped
that the stiffly seated and solemn-faced guests became
more talkative when the tea arrived. However, this
tea party may have been like the ones Ferdinand
Bayard attended in Bath, Virginia, of which he
wrote: “The only thing you hear, while they are
taking tea, is the whistling sound made by the lips on
edges of the cups. This music is varied by the request
made to you to have another cup.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a> At tea parties,
cakes, cold pastries, sweetmeats, preserved fruits, and
plates of cracked nuts might also be served, according
to Mrs. Anne Grant’s reminiscences of pre-Revolutionary
America.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Peter Kalm noted during his
New York sojourn in 1749 that “when you paid a
visit to any home” a bowl of cracked nuts and one
of apples were “set before you, which you ate after
drinking tea and even at times while partaking of
tea.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c007'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Sometimes wine and punch were served at
teatime, and “in summer,” observed Barbé-Marbois,
“they add fruit and other things to drink.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Coffee
too might be served. As the Frenchman Claude
Blanchard explained:<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c007'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >They [the Americans] do not take coffee immediately
after dinner, but it is served three or four hours afterwards
with tea; this coffee is weak and four or five cups are not
equal to one of ours; so that they take many of them. The
tea, on the contrary, is very strong. This use of tea and
coffee is universal in America.</p>

<p class='c004' >Dealing with both food and drink at the same time
was something of an art. It was also an inconvenience
for the uninitiated, and on one occasion Ferdinand
Bayard, a late-18th-century observer of American
tea ritual, witnessed another guest who, “after having
taken a cup [of tea] in one hand and tartlets in the
other, opened his mouth and told the servant to fill
it for him with smoked venison!”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c007'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >While foreign visitors recognized that the “greatest
mark of courtesy” a host and hostess could offer a
guest was a cup of tea, hospitality could be “hot
water torture” for foreigners unless they understood
the social niceties not only of holding a cup and
tartlet, but of declining without offending by turning
the cup upside down and placing a spoon upon it.
The ceremony of the teaspoon is fully explained by
the Prince de Broglie who, during his visit to Philadelphia
in 1782, reported the following teatime incident
at the home of Robert Morris:<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c007'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >I partook of most excellent tea and I should be even now
still drinking it, I believe, if the [French] Ambassador had
not charitably notified me at the twelfth cup, that I must
put my spoon across it when I wished to finish with this
sort of warm water. He said to me: it is almost as ill-bred
to refuse a cup of tea when it is offered to you, as it would
[be] indiscreet for the mistress of the house to propose a
fresh one, when the ceremony of the spoon has notified her
that we no longer wish to partake of it.</p>

<p class='c004' >Bayard reports that one quick-witted foreigner,
uninformed as to the teaspoon signal, had had his cup
filled again and again until he finally “decided after
emptying it to put it into his pocket until the replenishments
had been concluded.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c007'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >The gracious art of brewing and serving tea was as
much an instrument of sociability as was a bit of music
or conversation. This custom received the attention
of a number of artists, and it is amazing what careful
and detailed treatment they gave to the accessories of
tea. We are familiar with the journals, newspaper
advertisements, and other writings that provide contemporary
reports on this custom, but it is to the artist
we turn for a more clearly defined view. The painter
saw, arranged, and gave us a visual image—sometimes
richly informative, as in <cite>Tea Party in the Time of George I</cite>
(<a href='#fig5'>fig. 5</a>)—of the different tea time items and how they
were used. The unknown artist of this painting, done
about 1725, has carefully illustrated each piece of
equipment considered appropriate for the tea ceremony
and used for brewing the tea in the cups held
with such grace by the gentleman and child.</p>

<p class='c004' >Throughout the 18th century the well-equipped tea
table would have displayed most of the items seen in
this painting: a teapot, slop bowl, container for milk
or cream, tea canister, sugar container, tongs, teaspoons,
and cups and saucers. These pieces were
basic to the tea ceremony and, with the addition of a
tea urn which came into use during the latter part of
the 18th century, have remained the established tea
equipage up to the present day. Even a brief investigation
of about 20 inventories—itemized lists of the
goods and property of deceased persons that were required
by law—reveal that in New York between 1742
and 1768 teapots, cups and saucers, teaspoons, and
tea canisters were owned by both low and high income
groups in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<p class='c004' >The design and ornament of the tea vessels and
utensils, of course, differed according to the fashion
of the time, and the various items associated with the
beverage provide a good index of the stylistic changes
in the 18th century. The simple designs and unadorned
surfaces of the plump pear-shaped teapot in
<cite>Tea Party in the Time of George I</cite> (<a href='#fig5'>fig. 5</a>) and the spherical
one seen in the portrait <cite>Susanna Truax</cite> (<a href='#fig2'>fig. 2</a>) mark
these pieces as examples of the late baroque style
popular in the early part of the 18th century. About
mid-century, teapots of inverted pear-shape, associated
with the rococo style, began to appear. A pot of
this shape is depicted in the portrait <cite>Paul Revere</cite>
painted about 1765 by John Singleton Copley and
owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The fact
that a teapot was chosen as an example of Revere’s
craft, from all of the objects he made, indicates that
such a vessel was valued as highly by its maker as by
its owner. The teapot was a mark of prestige for both
craftsman and hostess. Apparently the famous silversmith
and patriot was still working on the piece, for
the nearby tools suggest that the teapot was to have
engraved and chased decoration, perhaps of flowers,
scrolls, and other motifs typical of the rococo style.
The restrained decoration and linear outlines of the
teapot illustrated in the print titled <cite>The Old Maid</cite>
(<a href='#fig14'>fig. 14</a>) and the straight sides and oval shape of the
teapot belonging to a late 18th-century child’s set
(<a href='#fig6'>fig. 6</a>) of Chinese export porcelain are characteristics
of the neoclassic style that was fashionable at the
end of the century. Tea drinkers were extremely
conscious of fashion changes and, whenever possible,
set their tea tables with stylish equipment in the prevailing
fashion. Newspaper advertisements, journals,
letters, and other written materials indicate that
utensils in the “best and newest taste” were available,
desired, purchased, and used in this country.</p>

<p class='c004' >Further verification of the types and kinds of equipage
used is supplied by archeological investigations
of colonial sites. For instance, sherds or fragments
of objects dug from or near the site of a dwelling at
Marlborough, Virginia, owned and occupied by
John Mercer between 1726 and 1768, included a
silver teaspoon made about 1735 and two teapot
tops—one a pewter lid and the other a Staffordshire
salt-glaze cover made about 1745—as well as numerous
pieces of blue-and-white Oriental porcelain cups
and saucers (<a href='#fig7'>fig. 7</a>). Such archeological data provides
concrete proof about tea furnishings used in
this country. A comparison of sherds from colonial
sites with wares used by the English and of English
origin indicates that similar types of equipage were
to be found upon tea tables in both countries. This
also substantiates the already cited American practice
of following English modes and manners, a practice
Brissot de Warville noted in 1788 when he wrote
that in this country “tea forms, as in England, the
basis of the principal parties of pleasures.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c007'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Tea furnishings, when in use, were to be seen upon
rectangular tables with four legs, square-top and
circle-top tripods, and Pembroke tables. Such tables
were, of course, used for other purposes, but a sampling
of 18th-century Boston inventories reveals that in
some households all or part of the tea paraphernalia
was prominently displayed on the tea table rather
than being stored in cupboards or closets. A “Japan’d
tea Table &amp; China” and “a Mahog[any] Do. &amp;
China,” both in the “Great Room,” are listed
in Mrs. Hannah Pemberton’s inventory recorded
in Boston in 1758. The inventory of Joseph Blake
of Boston recorded in 1746 lists a “tea Table with a
Sett of China furniture” in the back room of the
house, while in the “closett” in the front room were
“6 Tea Cups &amp; Saucers” along with other ceramic
wares.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c007'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >The most popular type of tea table apparently was
the circular tripod; that is, a circular top supported
on a pillar with three feet. This kind of table is seen
again and again in the prints and paintings (<a href='#fig1'>figs. 1</a>,
<a href='#fig2'>2</a>, <a href='#fig9'>9</a>, <a href='#fig14'>14</a>), and is listed in the inventories of the period.
These tables, usually of walnut or mahogany, had
stationary or tilt tops with plain, scalloped, or carved
edges. Square or round, tripod or four-legged, the
tables were usually placed against the wall of the
room until teatime when, in the words of Ferdinand
Bayard, “a mahogany table is brought forward and
placed in front of the lady who pours the tea.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c007'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
This practice is depicted in a number of 18th-century
pictures, with the tea table well out in the room,
often in front of a fireplace, and with seated and
standing figures at or near the table (<a href='#fig1'>fig. 1</a>). Evidence
of such furniture placement in American parlors is
recorded in a sketch and note Nancy Shippen received
from one of her beaus, who wrote in part:<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c007'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' > ... this evening I passed before Your house and seeing Company
in the parlour I peep’d through the Window and saw
a considerable Tea Company, of which by their situation
I could only distinguish four persons. You will see the plan
of this Company upon the next page.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the sketch (<a href='#fig8'>fig. 8</a>), a floor plan of the Shippen
parlor, we can see the sofa against the wall between
the windows, while chairs and tea table have been
moved out in the room. The table is near the fireplace,
where Miss Shippen served the tea. In the
18th century such an arrangement was first and
foremost one of comfort, and perhaps also one
of taste. The diary of Jacob Hiltzheimer indicates
that in 1786 the first signs of fall were felt on August
1, for the Philadelphian wrote: “This evening it was
so cool that we drank tea by the fire.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c007'><sup>[43]</sup></a> In the south
as in the north, tea—or, at the time of the American
Revolution its patriotic substitute, coffee—was served
by the fire as soon as the first winter winds were felt.
Philip Fithian, while at Nomini Hall in Virginia,
wrote in his journal on September 19, 1774: “the
Air is clear, cold &amp; healthful. We drank our Coffee
at the great House very sociably, round a fine Fire,
the House and Air feels like winter again.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c007'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Table cloths—usually square white ones (as in <a href='#fig9'>fig. 9</a>)
that showed folds from having been stored in a linen
press—were used when tea was served, but it is difficult
to say with any certainty if their use depended
upon the whim of the hostess, the type of table, or
the time of day. A cloth probably was used more
often on a table with a plain top than on one with
scalloped or carved edges. However, as can be seen
in <cite>Family Group</cite> (<a href='#fig1'>fig. 1</a>) and <cite>An English Family at Tea</cite>
(<a href='#frontis'>frontispiece</a>), it was perfectly acceptable to serve tea
on a plain-top table without a cloth. Apparently
such tables were also used at breakfast or morning
tea, because Benjamin Franklin, in a letter from
London dated February 19, 1758, gave the following
directions for the use of “six coarse diaper Breakfast
Cloths” which he sent to his wife: “they are to spread
on the Tea Table, for nobody breakfasts here on the
naked Table, but on the Cloth set a large Tea Board
with the Cups.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c007'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Some of the 18th-century paintings
depicting tea tables with cloths do deal with the
morning hours, as indicated by their titles or internal
evidence, as in <cite>The Honeymoon</cite> (<a href='#fig9'>fig. 9</a>) painted by John
Collett about 1760. In this scene of domestic confusion
and bliss, a tray or teaboard has been placed
on the cloth, illustrating Franklin’s comment about
English breakfast habits. Cloths may also be seen
in pictures in which the time of day cannot be determined.
Therefore, the use of a cloth at teatime
may in truth have depended upon the hostess’s
whim if not her pocketbook.</p>

<p class='c004' >In addition, trays or teaboards of various sizes and
shapes were sometimes used. They were usually circular
or rectangular in form, occasionally of shaped
or scalloped outline. Some trays were supported
upon low feet; others had pierced or fretwork galleries
or edges to prevent the utensils from slipping off.
Wood or metal was the usual material, although ceramic
trays were also used. At large gatherings a
tray was often employed for passing refreshments
(<a href='#fig4'>fig. 4</a>). “A servant brings in on a silver tray the cups,
the sugar bowl, the cream jugs, pats of butter, and
smoked meat, which are offered to each individual,”
explained Ferdinand Bayard.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c007'><sup>[46]</sup></a> The principal use of
the tray was, of course, to bring the tea equipage to
the table. Whether placed on a bare or covered table,
it arrived with the various pieces such as cups and
saucers, spoons, containers for sugar and cream or
milk, tongs, bowls, and dishes arranged about the
teapot.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Such tea furnishings of ceramic were sold in sets;
that is, all pieces being of the same pattern. Newspaper
advertisements in the 1730’s specifically mention
“Tea Setts,” and later in the century ceramic
imports continue to include “beautiful compleat Tea-Setts”
(<a href='#fig10'>fig. 10</a>). In the early 18th century, tea sets of
silver were uncommon if not actually unique, though
pieces were occasionally made to match existing items,
and, in this way, a so-called set similar to the pieces
seen in <cite>Tea Party in the Time of George I</cite> (<a href='#fig5'>fig. 5</a>) could be
formed. However, by the latter part of the century
the wealthier hostesses were able to purchase from
among a “most elegant assortment of Silver Plate ... compleat
Tea and Coffee services, plain and rich engraved.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c007'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
When of metal, tea sets (<a href='#fig11'>fig. 11</a>) usually
consisted of a teapot, containers for sugar and cream
or milk, and possibly a slop bowl, while ceramic sets,
such as the one seen in <cite>Family Group</cite> (<a href='#fig1'>fig. 1</a>), included
cups and saucers as well.</p>

<p class='c004' >While the tea set illustrated in <cite>Family Group</cite> appears
to have all the basic pieces, it can hardly be considered
a “complete” tea set when compared with the following
porcelain sets listed in the 1747 inventory of James
Pemberton of Boston:</p>

<table class="tc0" summary="">

</table>

<p class='c004' >In addition, the Pemberton inventory lists a silver tea
pot and “1 pr. Tea Tongs &amp; Strainer,” items that were
undoubtedly used with the ceramic sets.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c007'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Tea sets were even available for the youngest hostess,
and the “several compleat Tea-table Sets of Children’s
cream-colored [ceramic] Toys” mentioned in a
Boston advertisement of 1771 no doubt added a note
of luxury to make-believe tea parties during playtime.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c007'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
The pieces in children’s tea sets, such as the
ones pictured from a child’s set of Chinese export
porcelain (<a href='#fig6'>fig. 6</a>), usually were like those of regular
sets and differed only in size. Little Miss Livingston
must have been happy, indeed, when her uncle
wrote<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c007'><sup>[50]</sup></a> that he had sent</p>

<p class='c008' >... a compleat tea-apparatus for her Baby [doll]. Her
Doll may now invite her Cousins Doll to tea, &amp; parade
her teatable in form. This must be no small gratification to
her. It would be fortunate if happiness were always attainable
with equal ease.</p>

<p class='c004' >The pieces of tea equipage could be purchased individually.
For instance, teacups and saucers, which
are differentiated in advertisements from both coffee
and chocolate cups, regularly appear in lists of ceramic
wares offered for sale, such as “very handsome Setts of
blue and white China Tea-Cups and Saucers,” or
“enamell’d, pencill’d and gilt (<a href='#fig12'>fig. 12</a>), red and white,
blue and white, enamell’d and scallop’d (<a href='#fig13'>fig. 13</a>), teacups
and saucers.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c007'><sup>[51]</sup></a> These adjectives used by 18th-century
salesmen usually referred to the types and the
colors of the decorations that were painted on the
pieces. “Enameled” most likely meant that the
decorations were painted over the glaze, and “penciled”
may have implied motifs painted with a fine
black line of pencil-like appearance, while “gilt,”
“red and white,” and “blue and white” were the
colors and types of the decoration. Blue and white
china was, perhaps, the most popular type of teaware,
for it regularly appears in newspaper advertisements
and inventories and among sherds from colonial sites
(<a href='#fig7'>fig. 7</a>).</p>

(<i>USNM 397177-B; Smithsonian photo 45141-C.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Concerning tea, the Abbé Robin went so far as to say
that “there is not a single person to be found, who does
not drink it out of china cups and saucers.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c007'><sup>[52]</sup></a> However
exaggerated the statement may be, it does reflect
the popularity and availability of Chinese export porcelain
in the post-Revolutionary period when Americans
were at last free to engage in direct trade with
the Orient. Porcelain for the American market was
made in a wide variety of forms, as well as in complete
dinner and tea sets, and was often decorated to special
order. Handpainted monograms, insignia of various
kinds, and patriotic motifs were especially popular.
A tea set decorated in this way was sent to Dr. David
Townsend of Boston, a member of the Society of the
Cincinnati, by a fellow member of the Society, Maj.
Samuel Shaw, American consul at Canton. In a
letter to Townsend from Canton, China, dated December
20, 1790, Shaw wrote:</p>

<p class='c008' >Accept, my dear friend, as a mark of my esteem and affection,
a tea set of porcelain, ornamented with the Cincinnati
and your cypher. I hope shortly after its arrival to be with
you, and in company with your amiable partner,
see whether a little good tea improves or loses any part
of its flavor in passing from one hemisphere to the other.</p>
<p class='c004' >Appended to the letter was the following inventory,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c007'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
which provides us with a list of the pieces deemed
essential for a fashionably set tea table:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Porcelain, however, had long been a part of China-trade
cargos to Europe and from there to America.
The early shipments of tea had included such appropriate
vessels for the storage, brewing, and drinking
of the herb as tea jars, teapots, and teacups. The
latter were small porcelain bowls without handles,
a form which the Europeans and Americans adopted
and continued to use throughout the 18th century
for tea, in contrast to the deeper and somewhat
narrower cups, usually with handles, in which
chocolate and coffee were served. Even after Europeans
learned to manufacture porcelain early in the
18th century, the ware continued to be imported
from China in large quantities and was called by
English-speaking people, “china” from its country
of origin. Porcelain also was referred to as “India
china ware,” after the English and continental East
India Companies, the original traders and importers
of the ware. “Burnt china” was another term used
in the 18th century to differentiate porcelain from
pottery.</p>

<p class='c004' >Whatever the ware, the teacups and saucers,
whether on a tray, the cloth, or a bare table, were
usually arranged in an orderly manner about the
teapot, generally in rows on a rectangular table or
tray and in a circle on a round table or tray. In the
English conversation piece painting titled <cite>Mr. and Mrs.
Hill in Their Drawing Room</cite>, by Arthur Devis about
1750, the circular tripod tea table between the couple
and in front of the fireplace is set in such a way. The
handleless teacups on saucers are neatly arranged in
a large semicircle around the rotund teapot in the
center that is flanked on one side by a bowl and on
the other by a jug for milk or cream and a sugar
container. Generally, cups and saucers were not
piled one upon the other but spread out on the table
or tray where they were filled with tea and then
passed to each guest.</p>

<p>Figure 14.—<i>The Old Maid</i>, an English cartoon published in 1777. In Print and Photograph Division, Library of Congress. Although the Englishwoman apparently is defying established tea etiquette by drinking from a saucer and allowing the cat on the table, her tea furnishings appear to be in proper order. The teapot is on a dish and the teakettle is on its own special stand, a smaller version of the tripod tea table.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Pictures show male and female guests holding both
cup and saucer or just the cup. An English satirical
print, <cite>The Old Maid</cite> (<a href='#fig14'>fig. 14</a>), published in 1777,
was the only illustration found that depicted an
individual using a dish for tea, or, to be exact, a
saucer. In the 18th century a dish of tea was in
reality a cup of tea, for the word “dish” meant
a cup or vessel used for drinking as well as a
utensil to hold food at meals. A play on this
word is evident in the following exchange reported
by Philip Fithian between himself and Mrs. Carter,
the mistress of Nomini Hall, one October forenoon
in 1773: “Shall I help you, Mr. Fithian, to a Dish
of Coffee?—I choose a deep Plate, if you please
Ma’am, &amp; Milk.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c007'><sup>[54]</sup></a> The above suggests that the
practice of saucer sipping, while it may have been
common among the general public, was frowned
upon by polite society. The fact that Americans
preferred and were “accustomed to eat everything
hot” further explains why tea generally was drunk
from the cup instead of the saucer. According to
Peter Kalm, “when the English women [that is, of
English descent] drank tea, they never poured it out
of the cup into the saucer to cool it, but drank it as
hot as it came from the teapot.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c007'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Later in the
century another naturalist, C. F. Volney, also noted
that “very hot tea” was “beloved by Americans of
English descent.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c007'><sup>[56]</sup></a> From this it would appear that
“dish of tea” was an expression rather than a way
of drinking tea in the 18th century. On the table a
saucer seems always to have been placed under the
cup whether the cup was right side up or upside down.</p>

that handling a cup with the spoon in it could
be accomplished with a certain amount of grace. Teaspoons
also were placed in a pile on the table or in a
silver “Boat for Tea Spoons,” or more often in such
ceramic containers as “Delph Ware ... Spoon
Trays,” or blue-and-white or penciled china “spoon
boats.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c007'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Tongs were especially suited for lifting the lumps of
sugar from their container to the teacup. During the
18th century both arched and scissor type tongs were
used. Instead of points, the latter had dainty flat
grips for holding a lump of sugar (<a href='#fig16'>fig. 16</a>). The early
arched tongs were round in section, as are the pair
illustrated in <cite>Tea Party in the Time of George I</cite> (<a href='#fig5'>fig. 5</a>),
while tongs made by arching or bending double a flat
strip of silver (<a href='#fig17'>fig. 17</a>) date from the second half of the
18th century. These articles of tea equipage, variously
known as “tongs,” “tea tongs,” “spring tea
tongs,” and “sugar tongs,” were usually made of
silver, though “ivory and wooden tea-tongs” were advertised
in 1763.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c007'><sup>[58]</sup></a> According to the prints and
paintings of the period, tongs were placed in or near
the sugar container. Teaspoons were also used for
sugar, as illustrated in the painting <cite>Susanna Truax</cite>
(<a href='#fig2'>fig. 2</a>). Perhaps young Miss Truax is about to indulge
in a custom favored by the Dutch population of
Albany as reported by Peter Kalm in 1749: “They
never put sugar into the cup, but take a small bit of it
into their mouths while they drink.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c007'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Shallow dishes, such as the one seen in the portrait
<cite>Susanna Truax</cite>, and hemispherical bowls were used
as containers for sugar. Often called “sugar dishes”
or just “sugars,” they were available in delftware,
glass (<a href='#fig18'>fig. 18</a>), and silver as well as in blue-and-white,
burnt, enameled, and penciled china. Some containers
were sold with covers, and it has been suggested
that the saucer-shaped cover of the hemispherical
sugar dish or bowl, fashionable in the first half of the
18th century, also served as a spoon tray. However,
in the painting <cite>Tea Party in the Time of George I</cite> (<a href='#fig5'>fig. 5</a>)
the cover is leaning against the bowl and the spoons
are in an oval spoon tray or boat. Another possibility,
if the lid was multipurpose, is that it was used
as a dish or stand under the teapot to protect the table
top. Silver sugar boxes, basins, and plated sugar
baskets were other forms used to hold sugar,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c007'><sup>[60]</sup></a> which,
in whatever container, was a commodity important
to the Americans. As Moreau de St. Méry noted,
they “use great quantities in their tea.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c007'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Containers for cream or milk may be seen in many
of the 18th-century teatime pictures and are found in
the advertisements of the period under a variety of
names. There were cream pots of glass and pewter
and silver (<a href='#fig19'>figs. 19</a> and <a href='#fig20'>20</a>), jugs of penciled and burnt
china, and in the 1770’s one could obtain “enameled
and plain three footed cream jugs” from Mr. Henry
William Stiegel’s glass factory at Manheim, Pennsylvania.
There were cream pails, urns, and ewers of
silver plate, and plated cream basins “gilt inside.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c007'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
Milk pots, used on some tea tables instead of cream
containers, were available in silver, pewter, ceramic,
and “sprig’d, cut and moulded” glass.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c007'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Although
contemporary diarists and observers of American
customs seem not to have noticed whether cream was
served cold and milk hot, or if tea drinkers were given
a choice between cream and milk, the Prince de
Broglie’s comment already cited concerning his ability
to drink “excellent tea with even better cream” and
the predominance of cream over milk containers in
18th-century advertisements would seem to indicate
that in this country cream rather than milk was
served with tea in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010' >While the Americans, as the Europeans, added
cream or milk and sugar to their tea, the use of lemon
with the beverage is questionable. Nowhere is there
any indication that the citrus fruit was served or used
with tea in 18th-century America. Punch seems to
have been the drink with which lemons were
associated.</p>

<p class='c004' >Often a medium-sized bowl, usually hemispherical
in shape, is to be seen on the tea table, and it is most
likely a slop bowl or basin. According to advertisements
these bowls and basins were available in silver,
pewter, and ceramic.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c007'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Before a teacup was replenished,
the remaining tea and dregs were emptied into
the slop bowl. Then the cup might be rinsed with
hot water and the rinsing water discarded in the bowl.
The slop basin may also have been the receptacle
for the mote or foreign particles—then inherent in tea
but now extracted by mechanical means—that had
to be skimmed off the beverage in the cup. In England
this was probably done with a small utensil
known to present day collectors as a mote spoon or
mote skimmer. Although the exact purpose of these
spoons remains unsettled, it seems likely that they
were used with tea. It has been suggested that the
perforated bowl of the spoon was used for skimming
foreign particles off the tea in the cup and the tapering
spike-end stem to clear the clogged-up strainer of the
teapot spout. The almost complete absence of
American-made mote spoons suggests that these particular
utensils were seldom used here. Possibly the
“skimmer” advertised in 1727 with other silver tea
pieces was such a spoon.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c007'><sup>[65]</sup></a> No doubt, tea strainers
(<a href='#fig21'>fig. 21</a>) were also used to insure clear tea. The tea
dregs might then be discarded in the slop bowl or left
in the strainer and the strainer rested on the bowl.
However, only a few contemporary American advertisements
and inventories have been found which
mention tea strainers.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c007'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Punch strainers, though generally
larger in size, seem to have doubled as tea
strainers in some households. The 1757 inventory of
Charles Brockwell of Boston includes a punch strainer
which is listed not with the wine glasses and other
pieces associated with punch but with the tea items:
“1 Small Do. [china] Milk Pot 1 Tea Pot 6 Cups &amp;
3 Saucers &amp; 1 Punch Strainer.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c007'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Presumably, the
strainer had last been used for tea.</p>

<p class='c004' >The teapot was, of course, the very center of the
social custom of drinking tea; so, it usually was found
in the center of the tray or table. At first, only teapots
of Oriental origin imported with the cargos of
tea were available, for the teapot had been unknown
to Europeans before the introduction of the beverage.
However, as tea gained acceptance as a social drink
and the demand for equipage increased, local craftsmen
were stimulated to produce wares that could
compete with the Chinese imports. Teapots based on
Chinese models and often decorated with Chinese
motifs were fashioned in ceramic and silver. No
doubt many an 18th-century hostess desired a silver
teapot to grace her table and add an elegant air to the
tea ceremony. A lottery offering one must have
raised many a hope, especially if, as an advertisement
of 1727 announced, the “highest Prize consists of an
Eight Square Tea-Pot,” as well as “six Tea-Spoons,
Skimmer and Tongs.” By the end of the century “an
elegant silver tea-pot with an ornamental lid, resembling
a Pine-apple” would have been the wish of a
fashion-conscious hostess. Less expensive than silver,
but just as stylish according to the merchants’ advertisements
were “newest fashion teapots” of pewter or,
in the late 18th century, Britannia metal teapots. The
latest mode in ceramic ware also was to be found upon
the tea table. In the mid-18th century it was “English
brown China Tea-Pots of Sorts, with a rais’d
Flower” (probably the ceramic with a deep, rich
brown glaze known today as Jackfield-type ware),
“black,” “green and Tortois” (a pottery glazed with
varigated colors in imitation of tortoise shell), and
“Enameled Stone” teapots. At the time of the American
Revolution, teaware imports included “Egyptian,
Etruscan, embossed red China, agate, green, black,
colliflower, white, and blue and white stone enamelled,
striped, fluted, pierced and plain Queen’s ware
tea pots.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c007'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004' >Sometimes the teapot, whether ceramic, pewter, or
silver, was placed upon a dish or small, tile-like stand
with feet. These teapot stands served as insulation
by protecting the surface of the table or tray from
the damaging heat of the teapot. Stands often were
included in tea sets but also were sold individually,
such as the “Pencil’d China ... tea pot stands,”
advertised in 1775, and the “teapot stands” of “best
London plated ware” imported in 1797.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c007'><sup>[69]</sup></a> The
stands must have been especially useful when silver
equipage was set on a bare table top; many of the
silver teapots of elliptical shape with a flat base, so
popular in the latter part of the 18th century, had
matching stands raised on short legs to protect the
table from the expanse of hot metal. On occasion
the teapot was placed on a spirit lamp or burner to
keep the beverage warm.</p>

<p class='c004' >In most instances it was the hot water kettle that
sat upon a spirit lamp or burner rather than a teapot.
Kettles were usually related to the form of contemporary
teapots, but differed in having a swing
handle on top and a large, rather flat base that could
be placed over the flame. Advertisements mention
teakettles of copper, pewter, brass, and silver, some
“with lamps and stands.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c007'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The actual making of tea
was part of the ceremony and was usually done by
the hostess at the tea table. This necessitated a
ready supply of boiling water close at hand to properly
infuse the tea and, as Ferdinand Bayard reported, it
also “weakens the tea or serves to clean up the cups.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c007'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
Thus, the kettle and burner on their own individual
table or stand were placed within easy reach of the
tea table. According to 18th-century pictures the
kettle was an important part of the tea setting, but it
seldom appeared on the tea table. Special stands for
kettles generally were made in the same form as the
tea tables, though smaller in scale (<a href='#fig14'>fig. 14</a>). The
square stands often had a slide on which to place the
teapot when the hot water was poured into it.</p>

<p class='c004' >Both pictures and advertisements reveal that by
the 1770’s the tea urn was a new form appearing at
teatime in place of the hot water kettle. Contrary
to its name, the tea urn seldom held tea. These large
silver or silver-plated vessels, some of which looked
like vases with domed covers, usually had two handles
on the shoulders and a spout with a tap in the front
near the bottom. “Ponty pool, japanned, crimson,
and gold-striped Roman tea urns” imported from
Europe were among the fashionable teawares advertised
at the end of the 18th century.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c007'><sup>[72]</sup></a> The urn
might be placed on a stand of its own near the table
or on the tray or table in the midst of the other
equipage as it is in the painting titled <cite>The Honeymoon</cite>
(<a href='#fig9'>fig. 9</a>). Wherever placed, it signified the newest
mode in teatime furnishings. One Baltimorean,
O. H. Williams, in a letter dated April 12, 1786, to
a close friend, enthusiastically explained that “Tea
&amp; Coffee Urns plated (mine are but partially plated
and are extremely neat) are the genteelest things
of the sort used now at any House &amp; tables inferior
to the first fortunes.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c007'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p>Figure 22.—The sign of “The Tea Canister and Two Sugar Loaves” used by a New York grocer and confectioner in the 1770’s. Other “tea” motifs for shop signs in the 18th century included “The Teapot,” used by a Philadelphia goldsmith in 1757, and “The Tea Kettle and Stand,” which marked the shop of a Charleston jeweller in 1766.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The tea canister (<a href='#fig22'>fig. 22</a>), a storage container for the
dry tea leaves, was yet another piece of equipment to
be found on the table or tray. Ceramic canisters of
blue and white, and red and gold, could be purchased
to match other tea furnishings of the same ware, and
silver tea canisters often were fashioned to harmonize
with the silver teapots of the period. Individual canisters
were produced, as well as canisters in sets of two
or three. A set of canisters usually was kept in the
box in which it came, a case known as a tea chest or
tea caddy, such as the “elegant assortment of Tea-caddies,
with one, two and three canisters” advertised
in 1796.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c007'><sup>[74]</sup></a> Canister tops if dome-shaped were used to
measure out the tea and transfer it to the teapot.
Otherwise, small, short-handled spoons with broad,
shallow bowls known as caddy spoons and caddy
ladles were used. However handled, the tea could
have been any one of the numerous kinds available in
the 18th century. Although Hyson, Soughong, and
Congo, the names inscribed on the canister in <a href='#fig22'>figure 22</a>,
may have been favored, there were many other
types of tea, as the following advertisement from the
<cite>Boston News-Letter</cite> of September 16, 1736, indicates:<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c007'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >To be Sold ... at the Three Sugar Loaves, and Cannister
... very choice Teas, viz: Bohea Tea from 22 s. to 28 s. per
Pound, Congou Tea, 34 s. Pekoe Tea, 50 s. per Pound,
Green Tea from 20 s. to 30 s. per Pound, fine Imperial Tea
from 40 s. to 60 s. per Pound.</p>

<p class='c004' >In the 18th century tea drinking was an established
social custom with a recognized etiquette and distinctive
equipage as we know from the pictures and
writings of the period. At teatime men and women
gathered to pursue leisurely conversations and enjoy
the sociability of the home.</p>

<p class='c004' >A study of <cite>An English Family at Tea</cite> (<a href='#frontis'>frontispiece</a>)
will summarize the etiquette and equipage of the
ritual—</p>

<p class='c004' >On the floor near the table is a caddy with the top
open, showing one canister of a pair. The mistress of
the house, seated at the tea table, is measuring out dry
tea leaves from the other canister into its lid. Members
of the family stand or sit about the square tea
table while they observe this first step in the ceremony.
A maidservant stands ready with the hot water kettle
to pour the boiling water over the leaves once they are
in the teapot. In the background is the tripod kettle
stand with a lamp, where the kettle will be placed
until needed to rinse the cups or dilute the tea.</p>

<p class='c004' >Not seen in this detail of the painting is the entry of
a male servant who is carrying a tall silver pot, which
may have contained chocolate or coffee. These two
other social beverages of the 18th century were served
in cups of a deep cylindrical shape, like the three seen
on the end of the table. The shallow, bowl-shaped,
handleless teacups and the saucers are arranged in a
neat row along one side of the table. The teapot rests
on a square tile-like stand or dish that protects the
table from the heat. Nearby is a bowl to receive tea
dregs, a pot for cream or milk, and a sugar bowl.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</p>
<ol>

<li>
<p class='c000' >The footnotes, originally printed at the bottom of pages, were moved to the back of the book.</p>

</li><li>
<p class='c000' >Spacing within some citations was made more consistent. Except for that, and the cases mentioned below,
this book retains the spelling and punctuation of the original:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class='c000' >The title "Comte de Ségur" was mentioned twice, once spelled "Segur." This was changed "Ségur" for consistency.</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li><li>
<p class='c000' >The author referred to footnote 21 twice within the text. Both footnote references remain as links
that will take you to the footnote, but for technical reasons the link back into the text will take you
only to the first reference.</p>
